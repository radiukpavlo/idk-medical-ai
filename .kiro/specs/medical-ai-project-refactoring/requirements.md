# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive refactoring and enhancement of the MedicalAI Thesis Suite project. The project is a cross-platform desktop application built with .NET 8 and Avalonia 11 that implements AI for medical diagnostic complexes, including DICOM/NIfTI processing, segmentation, classification, knowledge distillation, and Ukrainian NLP reasoning. The refactoring aims to resolve all existing issues, improve code quality, ensure project functionality, and provide comprehensive documentation and setup instructions.

## Requirements

2. WHEN compilation is attempted THEN the system SHALL resolve all build errors and critical warnings
3. WHEN code quality is assessed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper error handling, null safety, and resource disposal
4. WHEN dependencies are reviewed THEN the system SHALL update outdated packages and resolve version conflicts

### Requirement 3: Project Configuration and Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all project configurations and dependencies properly set up, so that the application can be built and run without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN project files are configured THEN the system SHALL ensure all NuGet packages are properly referenced and compatible
2. WHEN build configuration is set THEN the system SHALL verify Debug and Release configurations work correctly
3. WHEN cross-platform support is tested THEN the system SHALL ensure the project builds on Windows, Linux, and macOS
4. WHEN runtime dependencies are checked THEN the system SHALL verify all required libraries and assets are included

### Requirement 4: Application Functionality Verification

**User Story:** As a user, I want the MedicalAI application to function correctly with all features working as intended, so that I can use it for medical image analysis and AI processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL launch without errors and display the main interface
2. WHEN DICOM files are loaded THEN the system SHALL process and display them correctly with anonymization
3. WHEN NIfTI files are processed THEN the system SHALL handle segmentation and classification workflows
4. WHEN AI models are invoked THEN the system SHALL execute mock inference or real model processing successfully
5. WHEN Ukrainian NLP features are used THEN the system SHALL process medical reasoning tasks correctly

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Documentation Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer or user, I want comprehensive documentation including setup instructions, usage guides, and troubleshooting information, so that I can easily understand, install, and use the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is created THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation prerequisites and system requirements
2. WHEN setup instructions are written THEN the system SHALL include step-by-step build and run procedures for all platforms
3. WHEN usage documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL explain all application features and workflows
4. WHEN troubleshooting guides are created THEN the system SHALL address common issues and their solutions
5. WHEN API documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL document all public interfaces and plugin architecture

### Requirement 6: Testing Infrastructure and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a robust testing infrastructure with working unit tests and integration tests, so that I can ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test projects are examined THEN the system SHALL ensure all test dependencies are properly configured
2. WHEN unit tests are run THEN the system SHALL execute successfully and provide meaningful coverage
3. WHEN integration tests are implemented THEN the system SHALL verify end-to-end functionality
4. WHEN test data is provided THEN the system SHALL include sample DICOM and NIfTI files for testing

### Requirement 7: Development Workflow and Build Automation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated build scripts and development workflow tools, so that I can efficiently build, test, and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build scripts are created THEN the system SHALL provide automated build processes for all target platforms
2. WHEN development tools are configured THEN the system SHALL include debugging and profiling capabilities
3. WHEN deployment packages are generated THEN the system SHALL create distributable binaries with all dependencies
4. WHEN continuous integration is considered THEN the system SHALL provide configuration templates for CI/CD pipelines

### Requirement 8: Performance and Security Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to perform efficiently and securely handle medical data, so that I can process large datasets safely and quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN medical data is processed THEN the system SHALL implement proper data anonymization and privacy protection
2. WHEN large files are handled THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage and processing performance
3. WHEN security is assessed THEN the system SHALL follow medical data handling best practices and compliance requirements
4. WHEN error handling is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages
