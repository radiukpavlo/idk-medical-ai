- ✅ **Avalonia Headless Testing** - UI testing without display requirements

#### Platform-Specific Considerations
- ✅ **File Path Handling** - Tests use `Path.Combine()` for cross-platform paths
- ✅ **Temporary File Management** - Proper cleanup of test artifacts
- ✅ **Culture Settings** - Tests verify Ukrainian localization support
- ✅ **Resource Management** - Proper disposal patterns in tests
